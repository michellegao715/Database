Usage:
	unzip lab0.zip	
	javac yoursql.java
	java yoursql

(Before create a new table, make sure there is no same table file that existed, e.g. if you want to
create table Students, delete Students.txt if there exists one. ) 

	CREATE TABLE Students (StudentID INT, LastName TEXT, FirstName TEXT);
	INSERT INTO Students VALUES (123, Smith, John);
	INSERT INTO Students VALUES (124, Emma, Stone);
	SELECT * from Students; 	(or SELECT StudentID from Students;) 
	
Explanation: 
1. If create a table which is already existed, then there is an exception. 
So manually delete the old table(file) if you want to create a new table with the same name.
2. Command line is case insensitive, and it will ignore leading/trailing spaces in command line. 
3. Type in "exit()" to exit from the application.  
4. The format of table saved in file:
StudentID|LastName|FirstName
123|Smith|John
124|Emma|Stone
